How would you change what you’re doing every day if you knew this was your fate? I hope you’d be kinder, to others and yourself. That you’d keep the important things in focus. That you’d appreciate your independence. That you’d be a reason for other’s joy. Mostly, I wish that you see and embrace the beauty in the ordinary. Your perspective and attitude might shift for the better. What I would give for just another “boring” day.
